    Hello everyone! Welcome to class 2; here's what we'll be doing today:

    <h2 id="guide">HTML Guide</h2>
    One important thing to keep in mind is that during the entire development,
    there will be many unknown tags and other things as such. Go to
    <a href="https://html.com/cheat-sheet/">https://html.com/cheat-sheet/</a> to
    see an interactive explanation of all these tags.<br /><br />Keep in mind
    that not <b>all</b> the tags will be used; you can feel free to explore
    those tags, but there is no need to know them (for this course).
    <h2 id="basic">Basic Tags</h2>
    We'll start off with formatting tags, which is the simplest of the basics:
    <ul>
      <li>
        To <b>bold</b> an element, we can use the syntax
        <code>&lt;b&gt;[text]&lt;/b&gt;</code>. For example,
        <code>&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt;</code> becomes <b>Hello</b>.<br /><br />
        Keep in mind that <code>&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;</code> have the same function.
      </li>
      <li>
        To <i>italicize</i> an element, we can use the syntax
        <code>&lt;i&gt;[text]&lt;/i&gt;</code>. For example,
        <code>&lt;i&gt;Hello&lt;/i&gt;</code> becomes <i>Hello</i>.<br /><br />
        Keep in mind that <code>&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;</code> have the same function.
      </li>
      <li>
        To <u>underline</u> an element, we can use the syntax
        <code>&lt;u&gt;[text]&lt;/u&gt;</code>. For example,
        <code>&lt;u&gt;Hello&lt;/u&gt;</code> becomes <u>Hello</u>.<br /><br />
        Keep in mind that <b>this is not good practice.</b> For now, you can use
        <code>&lt;u&gt;...&lt;/u&gt;</code>, but next class, we'll go over the
        "correct" way to do this.
      </li>
      <li>
        To <s>strikethrough</s> an element, we can use the syntax
        <code>&lt;s&gt;[text]&lt;/s&gt;</code>. For example,
        <code>&lt;s&gt;Hello&lt;/s&gt;</code> becomes <s>Hello</s>.<br /><br />
        Keep in mind that <b>this is not good practice.</b> For now, you can use
        <code>&lt;s&gt;...&lt;/s&gt;</code>, but next class, we'll go over the
        "correct" way to do this. In addition, keep in mind that
        <code>&lt;s&gt;...&lt;/s&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;strike&gt;...&lt;/strike&gt;</code> have the same function.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="pre">Preformatted Text, Newlines, and More!</h2>
    If you look at the source code of this website, you'll see that there are a
    lot of seemingly random line breaks; for example, this sentence looks like
    <pre>
        <code>    If you look at the source code of this website, you'll see that there are a
    lot of seemingly random line breaks; for example, this sentence looks like</code>
    </pre>
    Note the spaces at the front, and the intentional newline (and yes, you can
    scroll). But in the rendered HTML output, that's not what it shows. The
    reason is because spaces, tabs, or newlines (all called whitespaces) are
    "eaten" up by HTML to separate different portions of text, and then are
    replaced with spaces.<br /><br />
    So you might ask "how would I, then, be able to add a newline"? The answer
    is simple - use the <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tag. Now you might ask me two
    questions:
    <ol>
      <li>Where's the closing tag?</li>
      <li>
        What's the small slash doing before the closing bracket of the tag?
      </li>
    </ol>
    We can answer both questions very simply - for any tag,
    <code>&lt;tag /&gt;</code> just means <code>&lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;</code>.
    So we're not missing out on any opening tag.<br /><br />
    Now you might ask about how to insert two spaces. This is
    <b>slightly</b> more challenging, but you'll run into the same issue later
    on if you're trying to write a &lt; sign, and HTML ends up thinking it's a
    tag. The 6 most important "escape sequences" are:
    <ul>
      <li><code>&amp;amp; = &amp;</code></li>
      <li><code>&amp;gt; = &gt;</code></li>
      <li><code>&amp;lt; = &lt;</code></li>
      <li><code>&amp;quot; = &quot;</code></li>
      <li><code>&amp;apos; = &apos;</code></li>
      <li><code>&amp;nbsp; = &nbsp;</code> (non-breaking space character)</li>
    </ul>
    There are more (these can be seen when using Visual Studio Code), but they
    play minimal importance. To add 2 spaces, you can do
    <code>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</code>, giving &quot;Hello&nbsp;&nbsp;James&quot;.
    <h2 id="list">Lists</h2>
    So far you've probably seen a lot of lists been used so far. This is
    actually really simple to do! You don't count numbers or anything. If you
    want a bulleted list, you start off with an
    <code>&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</code> tag (<code>ul</code> stands for
    unordered list). For numbered (or <b>ordered</b>) lists, you'd use
    <code>&lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt;</code>.<br /><br />
    But I haven't told you how to put items there yet! All items are surrounded
    by a <code>&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag. For example, the following
    is an unordered list:
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
    </ul>
    while by changing the "u" to an "o", we get
    <ol>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="interactive">Interactive Elements</h2>
    Going to any website, like <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>,
    you'll see a lot of links and buttons; how can we make those? Links are
    simple; you can use the syntax
    <code>&lt;a href="[link to website"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code> to make a link
    to a website.<br /><br />
    <b>href</b> stands for "hypertext reference", and <b>a</b> stands for
    "anchor" (confusing as it is, you'll get it in a bit). To make a button,
    such as <button>Click me!</button>, you can just do
    <code>&lt;button&gt;...&lt;/button&gt;</code>. This won't actually
    <b>do much</b> until we get into using JavaScript. To make a go to the
    top button, we can use IDs to reference the top, such as
    <code>&lt;a href="#[id]"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
